# Task-3-Using-another-ROS-robot-with-SLAM-approach-to-create-and-save-a-map
I was able to complete this task from the help of the telegram group - spichal thankes to [mo7ammed-saleh](https://github.com/mo7ammed-saleh) for shearing his repositories gethub in the telegram group.

# HOW TO USE ANOTHER ROSROBOT FOR THE TASK
1.the steps to installing the ROSbot
similar to mohammad i took Refrences from [Amg0z](https://github.com/Amg0z/warehouse_simulation_toolkit/blob/master/README.md) and followed his steps

The steps i followed:
1.Downloading the ROS package using: 
```
sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-hector-trajectory-server ros-melodic-slam-gmapping ros-melodic-navigation
```

2.Installing the Build:
  2.1.first we clone the repository using:
  ```
    cd ~/catkin_ws/src
    git clone https://github.com/wh200720041/warehouse_navigation.git
    cd ..
    catkin_make
    source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
  ```
  in the terminal

  2.2.Then lunch ROS using:
  
```
    roslaunch warehouse_simulation warehouse_simulation.launch
```
After lunching ros these two aplicatios will start(gazebo,Rviz)

  3.Controling the similation there are two ways to control
  3.1.we can control the similation using the keyboard arrows in the terminal.
  
  3.2.Or we can you the [‚ôê2D Nav Goal] icon in the Rviz similation
  and that what i personally used for the ease of use.

4.Saving the similation map
4.1. We save the similation map by using this code `rosrun map_server map_saver -f ~/map` in a new terminal to save a photo of the similation map
